# Code-MultipleKernel
Our multiple kernel codes include multiple kernel dimensionality reduction and multiple kernel clustering. 
The code of multiple kernel dimensionality reduction includes supervised„ÄÅunsupervised and semi-supervised learnings, and the corresponding main code is MyMain_Supervised20220203.m,MyMain_Unsupervised20220203.m, and MyMain_Semisupervised20220203.m, respectively. 
The main code of multiple kernel clustering is MKKM_OurCode20220701.m.
